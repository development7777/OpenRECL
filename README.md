## About OpenRECL

**OpenRECL** is a Linux distribution based on [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/). Its desktop environment is built on [KDE](https://kde.org/).

The name stands for:
`Open, Refined, Easy, Creative Linux`, abbreviated as OpenRECL.

This Linux distribution offers the following advantages:

- **User-Friendly**: With a UI similar to Windows or Mac, users of those systems can easily transition.
- **Refined Design**: The KDE-based UI is sleek and minimalistic.
- **Lightweight**: By default, unnecessary UI animations are disabled, and unneeded applications are removed, ensuring smooth operation.
